# Weather App

Welcome to my Weather App repository! This project was developed to provide users with real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Below you'll find details about the project and how to use the app.

## Project Overview:

- **Objective**: Create a Weather App to display current weather conditions for a given city.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap API used to fetch weather data.

## Features:

- **Search**: Users can enter the name of the city they want to check the weather for.
- **Display**: The app displays the current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather condition icon for the specified city.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors gracefully and displays an error message if the city is not found.

## How to Use:

1. Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the input field.
2. Click the search button or press Enter.
3. The app will fetch and display the current weather information for the specified city.
4. If the city is not found, an error message will be displayed.

## API Key:

- To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you need an API key. Ensure you have a valid API key and replace `apiKey` in the JavaScript code with your own API key.

## Acknowledgments:
